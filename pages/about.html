              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <!-- paragraph tage will hold text about me -->
              <p>Welcome to my about page! My name is Burim Saliji    and I am a driven and motivated individual with a passion for web development. I am currently enrolled in the Coder Academy Standard Bootcamp and will be completing my diploma in IT web development at the end  of this year.

                In terms of my qualifications, I hold an Induction Safety Certificate, a Working at Heights Ticket, an Australian Driver License, a Cert III in Graphic Arts, and a High School Certificate. I also possess a range of valuable skills, including effective time management, problem-solving, fast learning, communication, and the ability to work both in a team and under pressure.
                
                Before my pursuit of web development, I gained over 5 years of extensive experience in commercial and residential window installations. During this time, I demonstrated exceptional skills in the use of hand tools, power tools, and measuring equipment, and effectively led and managed small teams. I also gained experience in effective communication and conflict resolution, ensuring the smooth organization of human and building resources.
                
                Prior to my work in window installation, I worked as a Head Printer at Kwik Kopy Wollongong for 8 years. During this time, I was responsible for running and maintaining a 4 color press, managing and ordering stock levels, liaising with customers, and training apprentices.
                
                I am currently working at Hanlon Windows Service and Warranty while I am studying at Coder Academy. This role has allowed me to continue developing my skills in a team environment, while also furthering my understanding of the importance of customer service and effective communication. I am excited to continue learning and growing in both my professional and academic pursuits. 
                
                Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!</p>
